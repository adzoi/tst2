# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## ✅ GitHub Pages Compatible

This project is fully compatible with GitHub Pages and does not require any server-side features.

### What Makes It Compatible:

1. **No JSON Fetch Dependencies**: All product data is embedded directly in `main.js`
2. **No CORS Issues**: No external API calls that would be blocked
3. **Static Files Only**: Only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
4. **Self-Contained**: All functionality works without a backend server

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Push to GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "GitHub Pages compatible version"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Scroll to "Pages" section
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

3. **Access Your Site**
   - Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/MedicineSeller`

### Features That Work on GitHub Pages:

- ✅ Product catalog with 13 embedded products
- ✅ Search and filtering
- ✅ Shopping cart functionality
- ✅ AI chat (local product knowledge only)
- ✅ Language switching (Russian/English)
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ All accessibility features

### Features That Don't Work on GitHub Pages:

- ❌ AI chat external API calls (falls back to local product knowledge)
- ❌ Real-time server communication

### File Structure for GitHub Pages:

```
MedicineSeller/
├── index.html          # Main page
├── styles.css          # All styles
├── js/
│   ├── main.js         # Main app logic + embedded product data
│   ├── products.js     # Product service (no fetch)
│   ├── ui.js           # UI components
│   ├── cart.js         # Cart functionality
│   └── ai.js           # AI chat (local only)
└── products.json       # Not used in production (kept for reference)
```

### Testing Locally:

```bash
# Start local server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8000
```

The application will work identically on GitHub Pages as it does locally!
